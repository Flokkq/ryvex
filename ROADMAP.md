# ryvex - ROADMAP

## **Initial One-Week Sprint**
This initial phase is crucial for laying the groundwork and getting a basic, usable text editor functioning in the terminal.

**Week 1 Goals:**
1. **Setup Development Environment**: Ensure Rust, `termios`, and any other tools or dependencies are correctly set up.
2. **Basic Text Editor Functions**: Implement basic editing capabilities such as:
   - Opening and displaying a file
   - Basic navigation (cursor movements)
   - Insert and delete characters
3. **Raw Mode Handling**: Utilize `termios` to handle raw input, allowing for real-time command interpretation without buffering.
4. **Initial Command Mode**: Begin implementing a basic command mode to handle simple commands (e.g., `:w` to save, `:q` to quit).
5. **Minimal UI**: Design a minimal user interface within the terminal, focusing on usability and performance.

## **Detailed 3-4 Month Roadmap Toward 1.0 Release**
This period will focus on expanding features, refining usability, and ensuring the editor is robust and feature-rich.

**Phase 1: Feature Development (Month 1-2)**
- **Enhance Editing Features**: Include more complex editing functions like search and replace, multi-line editing, syntax highlighting based on file type.
- **Key Bindings**: Implement Vim-like key bindings for all basic and some advanced operations.
- **Undo/Redo Stack**: Develop an undo/redo mechanism to handle editing changes effectively.
- **Buffer Management**: Implement multiple buffer management to open and switch between several files.

**Phase 2: Usability and Robustness (Month 2-3)**
- **Customizability**: Allow users to customize key bindings and perhaps themes.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the code for speed and responsiveness, particularly when handling large files.
- **Testing and Bug Fixing**: Create a suite of tests to ensure stability and start an intensive bug-fixing period.

**Phase 3: Preparing for Release (Month 3-4)**
- **Documentation**: Write comprehensive user documentation and possibly developer documentation if the project will be open-source.
- **Community Feedback**: Release a beta version to a limited user base or contributors for feedback.
- **Final Touches and Polish**: Address feedback, refine features, and prepare for the official release.

**Release Planning:**
- **Launch Preparation**: Finalize all documentation, double-check all features, and prepare marketing materials if necessary.
- **Release Day**: Officially release Ryvex 1.0 and monitor for immediate issues.

**Post-Release:**
- **Maintenance and Updates**: Plan for ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and potential feature additions based on community feedback.
